# Livechat-mongodb-architecture
Project related to database architecture for client-server live chat messaging for websites based on MongoDB and NodeJS

Project goal was to design and implement tools for livechat available for integration on third-party web pages.
Some parameters have been preset and some came with legacy. 
Some modules require additional querying e.g. statistics. 

Project was implemetned and doccumented along with suggestions for imporvement of code integration.
Suggestions for replication of the data.
Additional: file sharing between visitor and operator with mongofiles.

Data samples, queries and some additional data in file [mongojson_main.js](mongojson_main.js).

P.S. Actual mongo version for this project was ~2.1 so project doesn't take advantage of modern features of version 3.
